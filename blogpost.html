                    <h4>Electric Vehicles</h4>
                    <p>Introduced in 1890, these vehicles have a special ability to generate power through battery-operated motors and need recharging to maximize the cruising power. They produce lower overall vehicle emissions. Overall, these vehicles are lightweight, which means more acceleration power compared to fuel engines.</p>

                    <h4>Fuel Vehicles</h4>
                    <p>A typical vehicle that uses a spark-ignited internal combustion engine for generating power. The fuel gets injected into the combustion chamber and mixes with air, which gets ignited by a spark plug to produce energy. Can also be described as Petrol or Diesel vehicles with similar functionalities and operations.</p>

                    <h4>Hybrid Vehicles</h4>
                    <p>The combination of a fuel-based engine with battery motors to generate power for the engine. These vehicles are designed to switch from one power source to another for maximum fuel efficiency and energy. This combination makes a vehicle more capable, environmentally-friendly, and covers most distances.</p>

                    <h4>Hydrogen Vehicles</h4>
                    <p>A machine where hydrogen fuel meets the motive power generated by converting the chemical energy of hydrogen into mechanical energy. A mixture with oxygen in the fuel cell generates power in electric motors and causes less burning in hydrogen combustion engine, making these vehicles unique and drivable.</p>
